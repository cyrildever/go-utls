go-utls is a small Go repository where I put all the useful stuff I regularly need in my projects.
Feel free to use at your discretion with the appropriate license mentions.

_NB: I've developed the same kind of library for TypeScript, available on NPM: [`ts-utls`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ts-utls)_


### Usage

```console
go get github.com/cyrildever/go-utls
```

This repository contains the following modules:
- `crypto`: a proxy to Go-Ethereum's ECIES library and to my [`ecies-geth`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ecies-geth) JavaScript library;
- `io`: a light REST client utility on top of `fasthttp` with `Delete`, `Get`, `Patch`, `Post` and `Put` methods;
- `model`: a list of types I frequently use in my projects (such as `Base64` or `Hash` types) all implementing my [`Model`](model/Model.go) interface;
- `normalizer`: the adaptation of my Empreinte Sociom√©trique&trade; patented work for normalizing contact data (see its specific [README](normalizer/README.md) or use its TypeScript equivalent on NPM: [`es-normalizer`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/es-normalizer));
- a few common utility sub-modules:
  * `concurrent`: to handle concurrent maps and slices;
  * `file`: to find, know existence or get lines from files;
  * `logger`: a wrapper to the `log` package to output logs to stderr and a file;
  * `ntp`: another small wrapper to handle time with NTP;
  * `packer`: to marshal/unmarshal data (JSON, MessagePack, MongoDB's Bson, ...);
  * `utils`: a bunch of useful utility functions (`Flatten()`, `EuclideanDivision()`, `FromHex()`/`ToHex()`, back-and-forth conversions of byte arrays (to string, number, etc.), ...);
  * `xor`: to apply XOR operation to strings or byte arrays.

go-utls is a small Go repositoray where I put all useful stuff I regularly need in my projects.
Feel free to use at your discretion with the appropriate license mentions.

_NB: I've developed the same kind of library for TypeScript, available on NPM: [`ts-utls`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ts-utls)_


### Usage

```console
go get github.com/cyrildever/go-utls
```

This repository contains the following modules:
- `crypto`: a proxy to Go-Ethereum's ECIES library;
- `io`: a light REST client utility on top of `fasthttp`;
- `model`: a list of types I frequently use in my projects (such as `Base64` or `Hash` types) all implementing my [`Model`](model/Model.go) interface;
- `normalizer`: the adaptation of my Empreinte Sociom√©trique&trade; patented work for normalizing contact data (see its specific [README](normalizer/README.md) or its TypeScript equivalent on [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/es-normalizer));
- a few common utility sub-modules:
  * `concurrent`: to handle concurrent maps and slices;
  * `file`: to find, known existence or get lines from files;
  * `logger`: a wrapper to [`github.com/inconshreveable/log15`](https://github.com/inconshreveable/log15) module;
  * `packer`: to marshal/unmarshal data (JSON, MessagePack, Bson, ...);
  * `utils`: a bunch of useful utility functions (`Flatten()`, `EuclideanDivision()`, `FromHex()`/`ToHex()`, ...);
  * `xor`: to apply XOR operation to strings or byte arrays.


### License

These modules are distributed under a MIT license.

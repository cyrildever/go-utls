# About this `bip32` submodule

Because of dependency issues (and because I didn't want to use the `vendor/` folder in this lib), I had to make copy of the latest version from [Sammy's BIP-32 implementation](https://github.com/sammyne/bip32) which I use for making my own key pairs.

Therefore, the whole code in this folder is an (almost) strict copy of his library. I actually just remmoved the Goldie tests so they won't interfere with my code and made few "cosmetic" fixes.

I'm not going to say you may use my submodule as you wish: please refer directly to Sammy's and give him credit for it.
